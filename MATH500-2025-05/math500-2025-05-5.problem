After the incident with Harry Potter, the headmaster of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry removed the restriction on the number of participants in the FEWizard Cup, but introduced a preliminary test: a championship in magic duels, in which participants freely choose their rivals and arrange a duel (there are no draws). 
If any participant loses twice, he or she is eliminated from the Cup. 
When everyone took part in three duels, it turned out that only 2 participants remained in the Cup, and both had never lost. 
How many participants competed for the participation in the FEWizard Cup?
