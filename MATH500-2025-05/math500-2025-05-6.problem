The authors of the Olympiad received 99 candies as their salary. 
The first author took 1, 2, or 3 candies. The second author took one more or one less than the first. 
The third took one more or one less than the second one, and so on: each person takes one candy more or one less than the previous one. 
As a result, the last author just took all the remaining candies. 
Determine the minimum possible number of authors.
