An ant walks along the x-axis by taking a sequence of steps of length 1. 
Some, all, or none of these steps are in the positive x-direction; some, all, or none of these steps are in the negative x-direction. 
The ant begins at x=0, takes a total of n steps, and ends at x=d. 
For each such sequence, let c be the number of times that the ant changes direction. 
Determine the number of pairs (d, n) of integers with 1 <= n <= 2024 and d >= 0 for which c is even for exactly half of the sequences of n steps that end at x=d.
