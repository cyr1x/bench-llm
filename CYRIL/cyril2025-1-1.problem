A bathtub has a capacity of 150 liters. It has three faucets. The first can fill it in three hours, the second in five hours, and the last in ten hours.
Knowing that the bathtub leaks 35 liters per hour, How long does it take in minutes, despite the leak, to fill the bathtub by opening all three faucets simultaneously?
